                    <p>
                        REC has procured licenses for Google Workspace for Education: Teaching and Learning Upgrade to
                        conduct classes / courses in online mode. REC has always been a TECHNOLOGY FIRST INSTITUTION,
                        for the first time in CHENNAI, introduced the Lecture Capturing System (LCS) in 2019, as a part
                        of digital transformation to enhance the learning experience of the students and to revamp the
                        teaching style of the faculty to offer better contextual and relevant content.<br><br>

                        REC-LCS is an amazing way to extend material beyond the walls of the classroom. Students can
                        access their education content anytime, anywhere and can learn at their own pace by simply
                        logging in to the REC-LCS. Some students need to hear information more than once for it to sink
                        in. Others get new information that recontextualizes earlier material, and need to go back and
                        get everything to fit. REC-LCS makes it easy for the students to watch as many times as they
                        need to. They can even watch the video at a slower/faster pace if they want. Giving them control
                        over how fast they can watch makes for more efficient study habits.<br><br>

                        Impartus web application is a video-based learning platform that enables educators to capture,
                        edit, and distribute content. It provides students the deeper understanding of their topics as
                        they review classroom content at any time, from anywhere. The platform of impartus web
                        application is designed around real users and real learning needs, with robust security features
                        to protect your identity. Few unique features of the impartus web application include automated
                        lecture capture, remote access, live streaming, attachments, notes, video editing, bookmarks,
                        search, playlist, and so on.<br><br>

                    Rajalakshmi Engineering College has adopted many green cover initiatives, thereby
                    enriching the eco-friendly ambience of the Campus. Parking facilities are created for two and four
                    wheelers separately for both faculties and students outside the campus near entrance. Vehicle
                    parking sign boards are stationed at respective places. Security people are assigned duties on every
                    turn to ensure restricted
                    entry of automobiles in no parking areas.<br><br>

                    Staff members and students use bicycles/battery powered four-wheeler inside the campus to reduce CO2
                    emission and maintain fresh air inside the campus.<br><br>

                    The students and the faculty are advised to use pedestrian friendly pathways for convenience and
                    safety. Landscaping with trees is designed either side of the pathway to provide shade for the
                    pedestrians while walking, to add greenery and to control pollution inside the campus.<br><br>

                    The college has made many efforts to achieve plastic free environment. Circulars are given to
                    minimize the usage of plastic by all stake holders inside campus. Posters are placed in the campus
                    everywhere to motivate and to create awareness among our stakeholders to avoid plastic inside
                    campus. Dustbins are also replaced with biodegradable plastics and steel dustbins to promote ban on
                    plastics. <br><br>

                    The college always concentrate on planting trees and making the environment green. The campus has
                    nearly 3200 trees to support flora and fauna species and to support green initiatives.<br><br>

                    The observations indicated that the Rajalakshmi Engineering College campus has more than 30-50% of
                    wild, 50-60% native plant species and the other 20-25% plant species are ornamental in nature coming
                    under the planted vegetation. Native plant traits promote the indigenous fauna at the site area.
                    Hence, the accountancy of 35% of the wild traits are leveraged for the native animals and birds.
                    There are 211 species of creepers, plants, shrubs and trees in the campus.<br><br>

                    The most plants recorded are Azadirachta indica A. Juss., Tamarindus indica,
                    Pongamia pinnata, Cassia fistula, which are dominant trees species characteristic to the vegetation
                    within the campus. Some of the shrub species like Nerium oleander L., Nerium indicum Mill, Punica
                    granatum are also rather common in the campus.<br><br>

                    Ground flora is comparatively sparse, but fairly rich in undistributed areas. Some of the common
                    weeds like Euphorbhia hirta L., is found to be predominant. Species such as Catharanthus roseus,
                    Cynodon dactylon are some common herbs in the campus. Certain common climbers found among the shrubs

                    <h2 class="page-title">Bio Gas Plant</h2>
                    <p>
                        In REC, kitchen waste is used to generate thermal energy for cooking and heating.The bio-gas
                        produced from food waste, decomposable organic material and kitchen waste, consisting of methane
                        and a little amount of carbon dioxide is an alternative fuel for cooking gas (LPG). The bio gas
                        plant is set up to operate for 50 KG waste.<br><br>
                        Kitchen waste is processed and moistened to produce a suspension that subsequently undergoes a
                        fermentation process. Fermentation produces biogas – a valuable energy source – that is
                        desulphurised by biological means. Also, the waste materials can be disposed off efficiently
                        without any odour or flies and the digested slurry from the bio-gas unit can be used as organic
                        manure in the garden. The major components of the bio-gas plant are a digester tank, an inlet
                        for feeding the kitchen waste, gas holder tank, an outlet for the digested slurry and the gas
                        delivery system for taking out and utilizing the produced gas.</p>


                    <h2 class="page-title">Sensor based Energy conservation</h2>
                    In REC Sensors are used to control lights and water flow which helps to do energy conservation.
                    Sensor Based Solar Lights are installed in the college premises.<br><br>

                    <Strong>Water Flow Sensor</strong><br>
                    To monitor the amount of water being supplied and used, the rate of flow of water has to be
                    measured. Water flow sensors are used for this purpose. Water flow sensors are installed at the
                    water source or pipes in the library block, to measure the rate of flow of water and calculate the
                    amount of water flowing through the pipe. Rate of flow of water is measured as litres per hour or
                    cubic meters. <br><br>

                    <strong>PV Sourced Street Focus Lighting Systems</strong><br>
                    A photovoltaic-sourced street lighting system is most commonly promoted nowadays for illuminating a
                    street or an open area of rural and urban places. This system improves the efficient utilization of
                    energy consumption with the addition of suitable sensing and control devices. The main components of
                    the above system are the PV panel, Battery, Sensor, DC-DC converter, power electronics Inverter, and
                    real-time Timer. Here we prose a day-light sensor that opens the circuit electrically during the
                    sunlight's visible time period and closes the electrical circuit. The battery is used to store the
                    energy obtained from the Pohotovaltic array during the high sunshine time period and a suitable DC
                    to DC converter is used for charging the energy<br><br>

                    <strong>Wheeling to the Grid</strong><br>
                    A grid-connected photovoltaic system is an electricity generating solar PV power system that is
                    connected to the utility building load. A grid-connected PV system consists of solar panels, one
                    inverter, DC/AC isolator switch, a power conditioning unit and grid connection equipment.<br><br>

                    <strong>Operation of our system works:-</strong><br>
                    There are two grid connected system, one is solar PV system has connected Energy shortfall- internal
                    demand is more than solar energy produced is drawn from the grid and another one is PV system is
                    Energy surplus/excess power (solar energy produced is more than internal demand) is fed into the
                    grid-Power exported to the grid. <br><br>

                        Our college has very good water management plan to support all our water needs including both
                        ladies and gent’s hostel. The water management is well supported with rain water harvesting and
                        sump. The ground water is circulated to all overhead tanks using borewells. The college also has
                        a sewage treatment plant to do water recycling and use it for watering plants and to support
                        green energy.<br><br>

                        The rainwater is harvested to charge the rain water into the soil for ground water recharging.
                        The storage of rainwater on surface is a traditional techniques and structures used were
                        underground tanks, ponds, check dams, weirs etc. Due to certain difficulties on going ahead with
                        traditional techniques the campus has installed 16 to 18 numbers of ground water recharging pits
                        to recharge storm water/rainwater to maximum extent.<br><br>

                        The borewells are constructed in water abundant points inside and outside college. The ground
                        water was pumped to sump using borewell. There are totally 8 sumps inside the college to support
                        water necessities to cover all blocks of the college including hostel. The sump and borewell are
                        periodically monitored and maintained by plumbers and civil maintenance people to take immediate
                        actions. The sump water is loaded to overhead tanks. <br><br>

                        From the sump water is collected in overhead tank constructed at the top of each block. All
                        blocks have overhead tanks to support water necessities. The water from overhead tank is
                        separately treated by RO plant for drinking purpose. The drinking water is supplied in all
                        blocks. A well-arranged pipe network connecting sumps and overhead tank to the water
                        distributing point is established to support all water needs of the college.<br><br>

                        The institution always has a motto in saving water for future. In this regard a Wastewater
                        treatment plant of capacity 300KLD is available at the campus with present utilization value of
                        about 2,10,000 litres per day. The technology that has been adopted this WWTP is FMBR (Floating
                        Media Bioreactor) technology for the treatment of domestic sewage and other waste waters. This
                        technology ensures that the quality of the treated water confirms to the standards and
                        requirements as laid out by Central/State pollution control board and the same has been reviewed
                        and approved by NABL authorized laboratory on periodic basis to ensure on the quality. The water
                        recycled was used to gardening (70%), flushing toilets in Academic block (10%) and other
