                    <p>
                        Computer science and engineering graduates are the pillars of the current and emerging
                        information era. Opportunities include pursuing Master of Science Programs in reputed
                        Universities of U.S and Europe. and taking up research assignments in Hardware, System Software,
                        Computer Engineering, Multimedia, Networking and Communication areas.
                        <br /><br />
                        Computer science is a broad field with many different job paths to choose from. With so many
                        options, it can be difficult to decide on a certain route to study and focus on. Even if
                        mastering only one specific subject of interest in Computer Science is possible, it is necessary
                        to acquire all of the fundamentals connected to other areas in order to implement and use that
                        subject of interest. For example, when writing Server-side scripts, we must know how to obtain
                        data from databases and/or perform HTTP requests to retrieve information/outputs from APIs, in
                        addition to dealing with the Frontend elements and delivering accordingly. So, in order to use
                        databases and retrieve data via APIs, we must first understand the fundamental ideas and
                        applications.
                        <br>Job opportunities are ever increasing and are varied in nature. System study, analysis,
                        Design and Programming are the inherent phases in Application Development and each one of them

                        This degree program prepares students for Advanced Technical Computer Systems Design and
                        Development Work. It includes the study of basics with Data Science, Database Design, Data
                        Communications, Procedural and Object Oriented Programming, Operating Systems Design, Algorithm
                        Development and Applications of Artificial Intelligence. The curriculum includes basic course
                        work in Electronics Technology and the Theory of Programming Languages. Students focus on
                        developing computer-based solutions involving hardware and software components and integration.
                        Graduates are qualified to work in a range of positions, from entry-level computer scientists
                        and system engineers to project managers leading advanced applications of computer science to
                        real-world problems. The department has since broadened its research strengths.
